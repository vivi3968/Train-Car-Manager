# Train-Car-Manager

This is a train car manager for a commerical train. The train, modelled using a Double-Linked List data structure, consists of a chain of train cars, each of which contains a product load. A product load has a weight, a value, and can be dangerous or safe. The train car manager will be able to add and remove cars from the train, set the product load for each car, and determine useful properties of the train, such as it's length, weight, total value, and whether it contains any dangerous product loads.
